file_info:
^^^^^^^^^^^
    In this file everything for the output can be specified. If propertys are optional, in the code a default is declared. 
    Be careful: If you dont want to specify an option let the line empty. Don't delete any line! 
	Letting a line empty is just possible if there is a standard defined.

    1 line: Defines the name of the all files which is stored. Standard is defined: "result". 
	2 line:	Path where the files should be stored. Standard is defined: path of the folder where the program gets executed.
	3 line: Here it can be specified if the variable and/or fixed optimization variables should be stored. This creates at maximum two files
			"name_variable.csv" and/or "name_fixed.csv". Options: (Dont write the "" in the file)
			-"NONE" (nothing is stored)
			-"VARIABLE"
			-"FIXED"
			-"VARIABLEANDFIXED"

    Example if the standardpropertys for the plot name should be used:
    ________________________________________
    |                                       |   plot name
    |/home/user/project                   	|   path
    |......                                 |   ........


    Structure of the file:
