#This file is for specifying the bundles of the raytracer
#This values are automatically converted to a rays_dict
#If there should be more than two start values write 5&4&7 <- e.g. three start values
#Possible values for the raster object: At the moment only RectGrid is implemented 
#Write down just one line. More lines are not necessary and not supported. You can specify more bunderls within a line
